## Welcome to LE CLUB DES ARCHERS DU SUD OUEST DE MONTREAL

LE CLUB DES ARCHERS DU SUD OUEST DE MONTREAL is a not for profit organization formed in 2002 to offer members a place to practice archery in a fun, social, safe and relaxed environment at a low cost.

We welcome youth and elderly, beginners and experienced archers, individuals and families. We welcome both hunters and target shooters. At our club you can find Archers using traditional, recurve, and compound bows. We welcome all styles and equipment, except for crossbows.

The indoor shooting range is located at Centre Gadbois, in the Southwest Borough of Montreal. We set up practice targets as well as 3D animal targets, in a range from 5 to 30 meters.

We provide initiation, advice, all the equipment, and a lot of fun! You just have to show up and enjoy!
